**Customer Behavior Simulator using Weighted Graphs and configuration selector based on the Max-Cut concept.**

_About the idea:_

Let’s say hypothetically you are the owner of small business and you want to seed the market with your product. You’d like to know which influencers to give your product to for free in order to maximize sales of the product through their connection to others. You’d also like to minimize how many free products you give out.

Well, it turns out that this problem isn’t an easy one, but has an algorithm known as MAXCUT, which can aid in solving the problem. However, there’s a twist -- we’re going to simulate customer behavior over a period of many days, so it is actually multiple MAXCUT problems! Continue on to explore the repo about our approach...
